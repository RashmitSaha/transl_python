Once upon a time in a land of code,
There lived a programmer with skills to behold.
With Python in hand and logic so grand,
They crafted solutions that were truly bold.

From loops to functions, and classes too,
There was nothing this coder couldn't do.
So here's a message, simple and clear,
Keep coding, keep learning, and persevere!
